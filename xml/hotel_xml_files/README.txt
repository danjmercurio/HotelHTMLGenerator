These files were generated by the hotels.py script in the directory above
This was done to make handling each hotel XML tree much more managable on slower systems by splitting the original 18MB rates.xml file by each individual hotel tag
Two test hotel XML trees in particular were selected and moved to the parent directory, AAAAAA.xml and HNLADR.xml
hotels.py is a convenience script to aid in the process of developing the main script and will not be updated heretofore
